### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

   I really enjoyed Lab 12, especially part 1 as it created a unique 
   end product. The gradient gif was really interesting to see once 
   it was finished. It also was a good way to introduce using 
   ImageMagick and writing code to produce color.

* Lab 11

   For this lab, particulary part 1, it was interesting to work with
   a random number generator for the first time. I also liked the 
   end result as it created a game based on chance rather then user 
   influenced factors. Along with that it served for good practice 
   for logic in if statements.

* Lab 6

   Lab 6, part 2 was really fun to code because it created a fun 
   little game of blackjack in the end. It was a easy way to 
   introduce how to use command line arguements into the code.
   There was also parcticing with using arithmetic in code to 
   ensure a proper result.
